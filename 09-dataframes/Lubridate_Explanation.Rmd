# Lubridate

A great package, which an umappealing name!

## The Problem

How is the January 20th, 2016 represented in our data/code?

- "1/20/2016"
- "20-01-2016"
- "20160120"

## The Solution

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
mdy("1/20/2016")
mdy("20-01-2016")
ymd("20160120")
```
